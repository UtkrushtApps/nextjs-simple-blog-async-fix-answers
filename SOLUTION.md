# Solution Steps

1. Create a TypeScript interface for blog posts (Post) in a new file lib/api.ts, and implement an async function fetchPosts() that simulates data fetching and resolves to an array of mock posts after a short delay.

2. Create a new file lib/analytics.ts and implement an async function logPageView() that simulates a delay (e.g., representing an analytics API call). It does nothing but must fire and not block the render.

3. In app/page.tsx, import fetchPosts and Post from lib/api.ts and logPageView from lib/analytics.ts.

4. Declare HomePage as an async function (Server Component). Fetch blog posts with fetchPosts() and handle errors with try/catch, setting an error message if fetching fails.

5. Use useEffect (on client) to fire the logPageView async function in the background after page load. Errors in logging should not affect the UI.

6. Render the blog posts' title and content. If there was a fetch error, render an error message. Map over the posts, rendering their data with correct typing.

7. Style the output list and posts for basics, to clearly see separation between posts.
